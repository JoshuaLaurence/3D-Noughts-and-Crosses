3D Noughts and Crosses done in the python terminal

It currently only has a two player mode, but might possibly add an AI

It has a variable grid size, so you can play with a 2x2x2 grid, all the way up to a 10x10x10 grid!!!

You have get as how ever many grids you decided on in a row to win, ie a 4x4x4 required a stream of 4 X's or O's to win

You can win in all directions
- On one board
- Across multiple board
- Even diagonally across multiple boards

A win across multiple boards will look like this:
